# Development Environment Comparison: Local Machine vs Docker

## Running TAXW on Local Machine

### Advantages:
- **Process Management**: Run services (`rails s`, `sidekiq`, `webpacker-dev-server`) in separate terminals
  - Easier to read and filter logs for each service
  - Option to use Foreman for unified process management
- **Direct Access**: Immediate access to all processes for debugging
- **Performance**: Native performance without containerization overhead
- **Simplicity**: No container orchestration knowledge required

### Challenges:
- **Environment Consistency**: Potential "works on my machine" issues across team members
- **Manual Setup**: Installing and configuring all dependencies (`mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`) manually
- **Resource Management**: Services running directly on host machine consume resources even when not actively used
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Potential conflicts between dependencies (`mysql`, `redis`, `mongodb`) for different projects

## Running TAXW with Docker

### Advantages:
- **Environment Isolation**: Containerized services don't interfere with other projects
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent environment across all developer machines
- **Configuration as Code**: Environment setup is documented in Docker files
- **Service Orchestration**: Automated startup and shutdown of all required services

### Challenges:
- **Workarounds Required**: Webpacker-dev-server still needs to run on host machine 
- **Database Connectivity**: Potential issues like "Lost connection to MySQL" due to timeout when mounting volumes
- **Log Visibility**: Multi-services running in one terminal makes tracing logs difficult
- **Performance Overhead**: 
  - Volume mounting creates significant overhead, especially on macOS/Windows
  - Container virtualization adds resource consumption
- **Learning Curve**: Requires knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose concepts
- **Resource Usage**: Docker engine consumes system resources in addition to the containerized services
- **Debugging Complexity**: More difficult to attach debuggers to containerized processes
