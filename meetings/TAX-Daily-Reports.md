						I would like to know the progress of FindyTeam+
						We need to share the report using this template: official template.
						(I know Sato-san from #hrs_guild_devproductivity has requested or will request soon. He may share a different report file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XEc6wZ_3XS-D9y5gDG38IERPaVXJaTPEgRvdJvFMjjQ/edit?gid=1874849089#gid=1874849089)

						Do we have enough data to prepare the report? Or, still we need something to do with setup?

						- Select one or 2 capabilities.
				- TODO:
					- The first step is to read the "findee team plus document" to understand it.
					- The second step is to select one or two capabilities and add comments in column I of the document.
					- Instructions on how to configure Findi Team Plus are available in the document. Nas can assist with the configuration.
					- The process involves learning DORA capabilities, configuring Findi, and then collecting data. Data collection will be quarterly.
					- Nas offered to share relevant Findi documents with the team on Friday to help with understanding.

		:white_check_mark: Fetches PR diffs and reviews them using OpenAI
		:white_check_mark: Provides general feedback on the PR
		:white_check_mark: Posts inline comments on specific lines of code
		:white_check_mark: Suggests improvements when the PR is not approved
		:white_check_mark: Approves PRs if no issues are found
		It's easy to integrate the bot to your project using GitHub Actions.
		You can check the source here: https://github.com/moneyforward/ai-code-review-bot

			```
			Summary of the conversation between Nazmul and Yoko:

			The discussion primarily revolves around technical debt, encryption of data, and project planning.

			Technical Debt: Nazmul and Yoko discuss how to handle technical debt, specifically regarding items that have been acknowledged as needing to be addressed within the fiscal year 25. They debate whether to keep a separate sheet for technical debt or include it in the master schedule. Ultimately, they decide that having separate tabs is preferable.   

			Data Encryption: Yoko raises a question about project encryption, specifically whether all tax data will be encrypted. Nazmul clarifies that they need to confirm with the CFO about the specifics of the project, as some information may need to be encrypted while other data may not. Nazmul explains that they are working to determine what kind of data they are dealing with, which data is encrypted, and which is not, and will then discuss with the CISO office. 
			
			Project Planning and Clarification: Yoko seeks clarification on certain projects and tasks, such as the relationship master revision, and tasks within the swing 112. They discuss the importance of PRD (Product Requirements Document) review and the ongoing implementation of various features and improvements.

				2. Requirement wording: "In case of inputting numeric characters but the length is not 12 characters"
