1. **Ruby Version Update Discussion**
   - Current Ruby version is 3.1.4
   - Team is considering an upgrade to Ruby 3.2
   - Investigation phase is just starting
   - Need to check for potential issues with the upgrade

2. **Dependencies and Package Review**
   - Main focus is currently on Ruby and Rails upgrade
   - Need to review all third-party packages and gems
   - Plan to create an Excel file listing:
     - All packages in use
     - Their versions
     - EOL (End of Life) status
     - Reasons for using each package
     - Identify potentially unused packages

3. **Action Items Discussed**
   - Trance will make a plan and check dependencies
   - Gartney team will list out Ruby and Rails dependencies
   - Nazmul will share a template for product-wise third-party package information
   - Team will update after gathering more information

4. **Concerns and Considerations**
   - Need to verify compatibility with dependencies when upgrading
   - Some packages might need testing or verification
   - Important to document EOL (End of Life) situations for third-party libraries
   - Need to review if all included packages are actually being used

The conversation primarily focused on planning a Ruby version upgrade and establishing a systematic approach to reviewing and documenting all dependencies across their products.
