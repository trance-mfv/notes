This meeting transcript can be summarized into the following parts:

**Part 1: Introduction and Meeting Purpose**

*   Nazmul started the meeting by asking for a volunteer to take notes. He clarified that no specific notes were prepared beforehand.
*   He announced the initiation of three scrum teams.
*   Nazmul explained the purpose of this meeting is to discuss topics relevant to the development side on a weekly basis. This is separate from the bi-weekly TA management meetings that include PDM, designer, and Kiwi, which focus on individual website/keyword/PM site progress.
*   He also mentioned having weekly one-on-one meetings with Nas, Trance, and Reacher to discuss private topics like resource management.

**Part 2: Deep Productivity Guild and Lead Time Visualization**

*   Nazmul introduced the Deep Productivity Guild, in which Reacher is already participating.
*   He requested support for lead time visualization.
*   He referred to a document on lead time visualization to understand its concept and calculation. This is something PDPD is working on to confirm a template for calculation and storage.
*   The discussion covered how to calculate development lead time, defining the start (tech design started, test case preparation started, first code push) and end (all test cases fixed, bugs fixed, ready to deploy) dates of development. The term "ready to deploy" was discussed, clarifying it means all testing is complete and the environment is set up, even if actual deployment is delayed.
*   Nas confirmed that for some projects, testing is finished in a specific environment before moving to staging.
*   The output of the development phase is a test-ready environment and ready test cases.
*   A template is being developed to store this lead time data for potential future improvement.
*   Nazmul acknowledged that capturing lead time data might be easier for TA due to their existing dashboard. However, standardization is difficult as some product teams use different tools like Git or Notion. For teams like HRIS that use Jira without the necessary visibility, an Excel file is currently needed. The long-term goal is to use dashboards in Jira.

**Part 3: Findi Team Plus and DORA Core Model**

*   Nazmul introduced the second topic: the implementation of a DORA core model using Findi Team Plus.
*   The aim is to visualize and improve project characteristics. This is related to lead time but with more classifications.
*   The first step is to read the "findee team plus document" to understand it.
*   The second step is to select one or two capabilities from the left panel of the document that are most suitable for improvement. Other teams have already selected their capabilities and added comments in column I of the document.
*   Instructions on how to configure Findi Team Plus are available in the document. Nas can assist with the configuration.
*   It's important for everyone to have a Findi account, which can be requested through the CI tool.
*   Nazmul shared a sample report to illustrate the target output. Some mature teams have been maintaining this data for a longer period.
*   He suggested asking SMB members in Vietnam for help as they have practical experience with Findi. Charlie is in charge of SMB.
*   While Findi is recommended this year, it is expected to be a must-have for all MMBC teams/products next year. The process involves learning DORA capabilities, configuring Findi, and then collecting data. Data collection will be quarterly.

**Part 4: Monthly Data Capture (HRS Template)**

*   Satoshan shared another document (spreadsheet) for capturing data.
*   This HRS product template captures data on a monthly basis (example: March).
*   Nazmul suggested using this HRS template for initial monthly data input (March, April, May) as the official MMBC template might be too heavy initially. Later, this data can be merged into the official quarterly MMBC report.
*   Some HRS products have already started inputting data.
*   The HRS template is a supporting document, and the official template should be the target. For further input on this, the team can ask PDPD or regional Satoshan.

**Part 5: Next Steps and Closing**

*   The main purpose of the meeting was to bring everyone up to speed on lead time visualization and Findi/DORA core model implementation.
*   The next week's meeting will focus on discussing which Findi capability the team wants to consider.
*   Discussion about the team process was postponed due to time constraints but can be added to the backlog.
*   Nas offered to share relevant Findi documents with the team on Friday to help with understanding.
*   The meeting concluded with a Q&A opportunity and thanks to the participants.
