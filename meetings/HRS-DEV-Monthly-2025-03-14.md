This appears to be a transcript of a presentation about project management tips, likely translated from Japanese. The speaker, Akira from the Welfare Division, is sharing lessons learned from managing development projects.

The presentation covers four main factors that contribute to project failure:

1. **Not knowing what you don't know**
   - Solution: Address uncertainty by defining scopes, requirements, and schedules
   - Build prototypes early (get to 70% completion quickly)
   - Distinguish between variables and constants in a project

2. **Inability to make decisions**
   - Solution: Make decisions with minimum necessary information
   - Understand there's no single right answer
   - Have your own answers and support others' decision-making

3. **Poor buffer management**
   - Solution: Set buffers at the project level, not individual task level
   - Avoid Parkinson's Law (work expanding to fill available time)
   - Have precise estimates for individual tasks

4. **Neglecting bottlenecks**
   - Solution: Identify and address constraints using Theory of Constraints (TOC)
   - Focus on improving bottlenecks to enhance overall project performance
   - Recognize that bottlenecks shift as you resolve them

The transcript appears to be from a live presentation with some interpreter assistance, which explains some of the fragmented sentences and transitions between ideas.
