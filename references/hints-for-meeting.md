# Meeting

## Transitioning between speakers

Here’s a simple and professional way to handle transitions during your meeting, both when **you’re handed the floor** and when **you pass it on**:

---

### ✅ **When someone hands over to you**

Keep it warm and clear. Here are a few options:

* **“Thanks, \[Name]. Let me share my screen.”** *(then start presenting)*
* **“Alright, I’ll take it from here. Sharing my screen now.”**
* **“Thanks for the update. Here’s what we’ve got from the Garnet team.”**

---

### ✅ **While presenting (transitioning between sections)**

To keep things smooth as you move through your slides or KPT:

* “Next, I’d like to talk about what we’ll try in the next sprint…”
* “Moving on to the problems we faced…”
* “Let’s wrap up with what went well.”

---

### ✅ **When you’re done and ready to hand over**

It’s good to give a small wrap-up and clearly pass it on:

* **“That’s all from the Garnet team. Back to you, \[Name].”**
* **“Thanks for listening. \[Name], over to you.”**
* **“That’s our update—hope it was helpful. \[Next speaker], your turn.”**

---

### ❓ **Should you say “I stop screen sharing now”?**

You *can*, but keep it natural:

* **If you want to keep it simple**:
  “I’ll stop sharing now.”

* **Or let it be implied**:
  “That’s it from me—\[Name], you’re up next.” *(Then stop sharing quietly.)*

Saying it is fine, but don’t over-explain. It’s more important to keep the flow smooth and friendly.
