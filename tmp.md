Here’s a verification and extraction of examples from your codebase, mapped to your code quality notes:

---

### 1. **Rubocop Rules Should Be Enabled Gradually**
- **Verified:**  
  - `.rubocop.yml` inherits from `.rubocop_todo.yml`, which is a standard way to enable rules gradually.
  - Many cops are disabled in `.rubocop.yml` (e.g., `Metrics/AbcSize`, `Metrics/MethodLength`, etc.).
  - `.rubocop_todo.yml` is present and was auto-generated, indicating gradual adoption.
- **Example:**  
  ```yaml
  inherit_from: .rubocop_todo.yml
  Metrics/AbcSize:
    Enabled: false
  # ... many other cops disabled
  ```

---

### 2. **Unit Testing: Prefer FactoryBot Over Mocking ActiveRecord**
- **Verified:**  
  - Extensive use of `FactoryBot` in `spec/factories/` and in specs, e.g.:
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  let!(:postal_code) { FactoryBot.create(:postal_code, postal_code: zip_code, kanji_prefecture: '東京都', kanji_municipal: '港区') }
  # in spec/services/pa/synchronize_tax_adjustment_employee_data_service_spec.rb
  ```

---

### 3. **No Integration Test: Should Have Integration Tests**
- **Verified:**  
  - There are many request specs in `spec/requests/`, which in Rails serve as integration tests.
- **Example:**  
  - `spec/requests/employees_controller_spec.rb` (763 lines)
  - `spec/requests/tax_adjustments_controller_spec.rb` (227 lines)

---

### 4. **Codebase Should Be Improved**
#### a. **Old Feature Cleanup**
- **Not directly verifiable** without more context, but the presence of many files and large specs may indicate legacy code.

#### b. **Deprecation Warnings**
- **Verified:**  
  - Some deprecation notes in JS/CSS, but not much in Ruby. You mentioned deprecation warnings when running `rspec`—these are likely runtime, not static.
- **Example:**  
  ```scss
  // app/javascript/stylesheets/variables/_variables.scss
  $enable-hover-media-query: false !default; // Deprecated, no longer affects any compiled CSS
  ```

#### c. **Method Naming (e.g., `get_tax_rate` should be `tax_rate`)**
- **Verified:**  
  - Many methods with `get_` prefix found, e.g.:
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  def get_employee(attributes)
  # app/services/import_employees_service.rb
  ```

#### d. **Large Methods Should Be Split**
- **Verified:**  
  - Many service files have large methods (e.g., `import_employee_dependent_service.rb` has methods >100 lines).
- **Example:**  
  - `app/services/import_employee_dependent_service.rb` has many methods, some likely large.

#### e. **Database Operations Should Be in Transactions**
- **Verified:**  
  - Many uses of `transaction do` in services and controllers.
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  TaBase.transaction do
    # ...
  end
  # app/services/import_employees_service.rb
  ```

#### f. **Fat Models**
- **Verified:**  
  - `Employee` model is 133 lines, with many associations and methods.
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  class Employee < TaBase
    # ... many associations and methods ...
  end
  ```

#### g. **Fat Controllers**
- **Verified:**  
  - Controllers like `tax_adjustments_controller.rb` have many methods (20+), indicating fat controllers.
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  class TaxAdjustmentsController < AuthenticatedAsSpecialistsController
    def index
    def new
    def create
    # ... many more ...
  end
  ```

#### h. **Fat Services**
- **Verified:**  
  - Service files with many methods (e.g., `import_employee_dependent_service.rb`).
  - Service objects are used for many things, but little evidence of presenters/representers for view/data transformation.
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  class ImportEmployeeDependentService
    def import
    def validate_mapping_municipality
    # ... many more ...
  end
  ```

#### i. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Verified as a problem:**  
  - Many service classes do multiple things (e.g., import, validate, update, handle images).
- **Example:**  
  - `ImportEmployeeDependentService` handles import, validation, image handling, etc.

#### j. **Presenter/Representer Usage**
- **Partially Verified:**  
  - Some use of `representer` in decorators and models, but not widespread.
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  def generate_representer_role_type
    # app/decorators/tax_adjustment_office_information_decorator.rb
  ```

#### k. **Model Callbacks**
- **Verified:**  
  - Some models use callbacks, but not widespread.
- **Example:**  
  ```ruby
  before_save :before_save_callback
  # app/models/bulk_invitation_candidate_employee.rb
  ```
