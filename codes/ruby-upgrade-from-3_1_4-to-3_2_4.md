   - With rbenv: `rbenv install 3.2.4 && rbenv local 3.2.4`
   - With RVM: `rvm install 3.2.4 && rvm use 3.2.4`
   - With asdf: `asdf install ruby 3.2.4 && asdf local ruby 3.2.4`

3. Update your dependencies:
   ```
   bundle update
   ```

4. Check for compatibility issues in your test suite:
   ```
   bundle exec rspec
   ```
