The conversation between Nazmul (alam.nazmul) and Yoko Saito in the provided document focuses on planning, technical debt management, and data encryption policies for the ongoing sprint (Sprint 112, running from March 17 to March 29, 2025). Below is a summary of their key exchanges:

### Key Points of Discussion

1. **Technical Debt Management**
   - **Nazmul’s Concern**: Nazmul raises the topic of technical debt, suggesting that certain tech debt items (e.g., encryption improvements, feature flags, and recent caption) should be integrated into the master schedule as roadmap items rather than kept separate. He emphasizes confirming these with both the product development management (PDM) and technical sides.
   - **Yoko’s Response**: Yoko agrees and asks for clarification, requesting the Jira project link to track these items. She is flexible about whether technical debt should be in a separate tab or merged into the main schedule, leaving it to Nazmul’s discretion.
   - **Resolution**: They agree to use separate tabs for technical debt to avoid confusion with the project roadmap. Nazmul suggests tagging tech debt items for clarity, and Yoko supports this approach, noting she will handle technical debt as needed.

2. **Data Encryption and Compliance**
   - **Nazmul’s Input**: Nazmul highlights the company’s standard data encryption policy mandated by the CISO, requiring encryption of personal data. He notes they are identifying which data (e.g., tax data, personal information) is encrypted or not and will consult the CISO if compliance is unfeasible. He mentions ongoing discussions with Haradasan and a need to align with CISO expectations.
   - **Yoko’s Response**: Yoko seeks clarity on which data will be encrypted in the project and appreciates the provided Kibela and CISO document references to understand the gap. She agrees to review these and acknowledges the complexity, thanking Nazmul for the clarification.
   - **Nas’s Contribution**: Nas adds that they need to confirm with the CFO and setup team about encryption requirements (e.g., for login IDs or emails), suggesting some data might not need encryption based on standard tiers (e.g., T2, T3).
   - **Outcome**: The team agrees to finalize the encryption plan after consulting the CISO and setup team, with Yoko committing to review related documents.

3. **Sprint Planning and Confirmation**
   - **Nazmul’s Follow-Up**: Toward the end, Nazmul confirms the technical debt items (e.g., recent caption, feature flags) for the next sprint, ensuring they align with FY25 goals. He stresses moving confirmed tech debt into the master schedule.
   - **Yoko’s Acknowledgment**: Yoko supports this and asks for the Jira link again, reinforcing her willingness to adapt the schedule (separate tabs or merged) based on team needs.
   - **Nas’s Input**: Nas agrees to update the epic for technical debt in Jira and leaves some items (e.g., migration-related debt) in the current sheet if deemed essential.

### Summary of Decisions
- **Technical Debt**: Agreed to manage tech debt in a separate tab in the master schedule, with clear tagging, and move confirmed items into the roadmap after PDM and technical team approval.
- **Encryption**: The team will assess data encryption needs, consult the CISO and CFO, and document the current state (encrypted vs. non-encrypted data) to ensure compliance, with Yoko reviewing related materials.
- **Action Items**: Nazmul will share the Jira epic link, and Nas will follow up with the setup team on encryption details, updating the team accordingly.
