# Recent Issues
- A "silly bug" was released to market due to inadequate process
- Refactoring, especially in technical debt areas, can cause serious issues if done without proper documentation and notification


## New Process Requirements

- Impact analysis is mandatory - Before any release, impact analysis must be completed
- QA team must be informed - Impact analysis should be shared with QA in advance so they understand what to check

## Types of Impact Analysis
- Code/Engineering Impact - Developers need to identify which areas might be affected by code changes
- Business Logic Impact - PDMs and QA team should evaluate business-side impacts

## Documentation Requirements
- Impact areas should be clearly documented in release notes and test planning
- Impact analysis should be categorized into business impact and engineering impact

## Team Collaboration
- Developers know best about code modifications and potential side effects
- PDMs should evaluate impacts for new requirements
- QA can provide insights from a use case perspective
