[Nas] 09:32:25
No, that's good.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:32:28
Yeah.

[Nas] 09:32:31
Yep.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:32:34
Can I check cytosan will join or not? Please.

[Yoko Saito] 09:33:08
Sorry for my late….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:33:11
Okay, let's start.

[Nas] 09:33:17
Okay, so, uh…. First, I would like to start a, uh, related to the March checking UI.

[Nas] 09:33:24
Rule 1. So, uh, yesterday we summarized, uh, for the tickets.

[Nas] 09:33:28
And, uh, so those are an ice billows. So, uh, for the… the first one, the design enrollment to the list procedures.

[Nas] 09:33:37
We, uh, intended to use apply the feature plan, and uh….

[Nas] 09:33:41
It's pretty quiet. It's required additional form maintenance efforts. The second and the third ticket, we, uh, we….

[Nas] 09:33:52
Apply for the, uh, four-year 25…. From September, starting from September, and we see the required action to….

[Nas] 09:34:02
Need attention from BDM is, uh, to inform SR…. So check on our CSDI to check the action before September.

[Nas] 09:34:11
So, uh…. You see a data topic, I would like to….

[Nas] 09:34:15
When I'll discuss it.

[Yoko Saito] 09:34:18
Yeah, okay. So, um…. I want to confirm, uh….

[Yoko Saito] 09:34:26
It's a nursing. So, uh, you are saying that, uh, for the first one.

[Yoko Saito] 09:34:30
Um, sorry, uh…. For the first one, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:34:38
169… 1697. Um, this is already applied to the, uh, current year.

[Yoko Saito] 09:34:46
So, uh, in the current, uh, production. So, um…. Our choices to use the, uh….

[Yoko Saito] 09:34:58
Pizza frog, or informed. Uh, ask to… ask Aaron.

[Yoko Saito] 09:35:04
The document creation team to update the feature. Is this correct? So, we have two choices.

[Yoko Saito] 09:35:12
Right?

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:14
Yes, Saitas, and let me explain the situation. There are 3 tickets already deployed in the production.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:19
All these three tickets is actually deployed in the production. But among these.

[Yoko Saito] 09:35:24
Sorry, but you said 2 tickets? 3. Okay, yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:27
3 tickets. All tickets…. Already deployed in the production. They are available in the production.

[Yoko Saito] 09:35:32
Yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:34
But, uh, the first ticket is applied for every fiscal year.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:39
So, it is… it is not… depends on, uh, this…. Er, uh, ER leaders open.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:46
Things. But another two tickets depends on yearly task open situation. So.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:53
Next to ticket will be only available if someone is open for yearly tasks.

[Yoko Saito] 09:35:58
Yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:35:58
So that means before September, if they update the user manual, the next two tickets has no problem.

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:06
Okay, yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:36:07
But first ticket, as it is already available for all year, and.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:36:12
In the production, so that means there are two up…. Actually, there are 3 options.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:36:17
One option is that…. Feature flag. Second option is update the content immediately. Third option is revert back.

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:26
Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, and so, uh….

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:31
For the, um, for the last two. We don't have any issues, because, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:38
Um, Doug…. Document creation teams, uh, already, uh, have a plan to update.

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:45
Um, their document. After… of the….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:36:48
Yeah.

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:51
Um, after September, so on. We already informed them that.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:36:55
I….

[Yoko Saito] 09:36:58
The last two. So, 1708. And, uh, 1581.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:37:00
So, uh, just to confirm, so when they are going to update the UI content in… for end user.

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:05
So, we already informed them that we will have an, uh, UI update.

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:10
Uh, for this year and, I mean, uh, after September. So, for the last two, uh, we don't have any issues here.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:37:26
Do… do nothing?

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:27
Uh…. After September.

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:31
1st of September. Yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:37:32
Okay, first of all, then it's okay. So, uh, from 1st of September, this can be available to individuals, so if the content is updated, for example, by end of August.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:37:45
Then no problem, no issue.

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:48
Yeah. So, uh, so the….

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:52
I think on, uh, the, the issue here is only first one.

[Yoko Saito] 09:37:57
Uh, 169… 1697. So, uh, could you open the, uh, Jira?

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:37:57
Yeah, then it…. Yes.

[Nas] 09:38:07
This one? Go ahead.

[Yoko Saito] 09:38:08
Uh, yes. Um, this is the confirmation to Le Cous. So, uh, according to this JIRA.

[Yoko Saito] 09:38:15
Uh, we have… we have changed only two UIs. Is this correct?

[Nas] 09:38:22
Yes. Actually, it was just only one page.

[Yoko Saito] 09:38:26
Okay, um, in that case, I think on, uh, we can ask, uh, the document creation team to update.

[Yoko Saito] 09:38:35
Uh, those as soon as possible. So….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:38:38
Yeah, the reason Cytesan, I don't want to go for, uh.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:38:42
Feature flag. Actually, as you know, that feature plug-in many issues are happening. I don't want to take chance to have another issue.

[Yoko Saito] 09:38:51
Yeah, and uh…. I don't want to, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:38:57
Use the, uh, the effort. To just un switch….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:39:03
Uh, any particular one.

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:03
Peter Frank. So, um, vehicles, uh, yeah, Leko-san, do you think on….

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:09
Uh, it's okay to ask on CS and on success to….

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:13
Update their documents. Materials.

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:20
Titro, so disco.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:39:21
Please update me.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:39:24
You mean you're asking me to do it, right?

[aoyama.reiko] 09:39:27
Thank you very much.

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:30
Ano corre…. Sudani.

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:36
When you guys schedule, so that it disconnect.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:39:47
Yes, that's right. If you're busy with CS, I can help replace the images.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:39:53
If I could say so.

[Yoko Saito] 09:39:56
So then we don't worry about that. I don't know. Hi, I thought, great.

[Yoko Saito] 09:40:02
Study.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:40:03
Okay.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:40:07
Cloud Study hasn't told me about it yet, but I think we should let them know at yesterday's meeting.

[Yoko Saito] 09:40:13
Okay, then, uh. We agreed that we will ask CS.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:40:18
That's right.

[aoyama.reiko] 09:40:40
Yes.

[Yoko Saito] 09:40:40
To update, uh…. The support guide.

[Yoko Saito] 09:40:45
So…. I think that's okay. I think that's okay.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:40:52
Very much, okay.

[Nas] 09:40:55
So, we choice this solution, right? Okay.

[Yoko Saito] 09:40:59
Yes, yes?

[Nas] 09:41:04
Okay, thank you. So….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:41:08
So, at the same time.

[Nas] 09:41:10
Yeah, okay. Um, the next topic, uh….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:41:15
Yeah, as Reiko-san is going to discuss with the design document update, take an action document update, just at the same time.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:41:24
Reconfirm that the number 2 and number 3, 1708, 1581. Design content will be updated before.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:41:34
September, by end of August.

[Yoko Saito] 09:41:36
Yeah. Um, yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:41:41
Good recon pumps.

[Yoko Saito] 09:41:42
Yes, uh…. Yeah, I will confirm, but, uh, not only those, uh.

[Yoko Saito] 09:41:49
Ur is what we have, you know, auto-reading, um…. Improvement and others. So, uh, we, we already, uh, um, shared that information, but, uh, I….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:41:53
Hi, hi, hi, hi, so let's go.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:42:01
Yeah, just a little issue happened, so I wonder if there is, again, something, so we….

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:01
We will confirm. Again. Okay.

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:06
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:42:10
I think I smell, so….

[Nas] 09:42:22
And that's the point I would like to discuss, either related to the postponed relationship master revision.

[Nas] 09:42:28
We have just won the release, uh, last week, and we, uh, are not still aware about, uh.

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:28
Yeah.

[Nas] 09:42:34
New release timeline for, uh, for this? Do you have any information?

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:38
Yeah, okay, so, um, could you go down to the, uh, PDM section?

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:44
Yes, I…. I gave some information about this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:50
So, we have…. We need a PDM site.

[Yoko Saito] 09:42:56
Have decided. To cancel this….

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:00
Project. Um, I will explain the lesson. Why? So, uh, could you open the, uh, presentation here?

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:14
So, uh, this is, uh, one of the, uh, information, uh, from the, uh, HR Master.

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:21
Project. So, and then, uh, this is a relation master. Uh… contents.

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:28
So, uh, if you look at the, uh, TEA. Uh, currently, we are using husband-wife, daughter, son.

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:38
And are in our…. 1413….

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:44
Project. We have changed. Adults, husband and wife, two spouse.

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:49
And those are unsung to child. And, uh, we canceled this release.

[Yoko Saito] 09:43:57
Uh, on…. 19th of July, or 19th of June.

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:05
Uh, the issue here is that, uh…. We have two reasons.

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:12
So, uh, one is that, uh, we have an, uh, import an import, um, feature.

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:19
From PA, and export feature to, um, HRIS. As you see in this….

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:29
Uh… in this chart. Um, PA and….

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:34
Hris have a different. Content around the, uh, spouse and children.

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:41
So, um, currently, PA has husband, wife, daughter, son, uh, it got, um, it is the same as, uh, current TA.

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:49
But the, uh, for, uh, HRIS, uh, we have, uh. Different, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:44:59
Table. So, husband, wife, and then child, but with the, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:04
Um, the 6th. And so, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:12
P… this project itself. Is under 3 yards.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:17
And, uh, we… we are… we are not sure if we will cancel this project itself.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:23
Or postpone the project. But anyway, we have already decided that.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:29
A PA, we do not work on this project. Before August.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:36
You know, that, uh, for TA, we need to make all of the works.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:42
But before, uh, 1st of September, by end of August. But Pierre will not work on this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:49
Uh, at least before. 1st of September.

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:54
That means we need…. We need to, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:45:59
Say…. Change this, uh, import process.

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:07
If we release this 1413. But we don't have enough time to work on this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:16
From now, before 1st of September. Right?

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:22
And also, we need to work on the export to HRIS.

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:28
Because we have, uh, different, uh, tables on spouse and children.

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:34
So, um, that means we need to work on those, uh, import and export features.

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:39
Before 1st of September. But we don't have enough time for this year, at least.

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:46
So, this is the… one of the reasons. Why we canceled this?

[Yoko Saito] 09:46:51
Feature, uh, 1413. This year. And another reason is that, as I said.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:01
Are in… in this project, an HR Master project. We have not decided.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:07
What it should be, what they…. Should be. So, our to-be has not been decided yet in the HR Master project.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:18
So, currently, uh, CDB has an husband-wife at child abuse, um.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:25
On gender, so female and male. Uh, but, uh….

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:31
This… this should be already considered, and uh… even PA. They are not sure if they have the same.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:40
Our tables are CDB. Yet. Because it's, um… because we are wondering if it's meaningful or not.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:49
So, um…. So, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:54
Ta has already, say, changed it to a spouse and a child.

[Yoko Saito] 09:47:58
But we are not sure yet. If it's… if we….

[Yoko Saito] 09:48:03
You know, if we have and are the same flavor as, um, HR Master.

[Yoko Saito] 09:48:09
It's possible that we need to change this again. In future, of the, um, HR must start… HR Master project.

[Yoko Saito] 09:48:19
We release target. So, uh, this is a second reason why.

[Yoko Saito] 09:48:24
We have decided we canceled this, uh, 1413. Um, any questions?

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:48:35
Not… not questions, Saterson. So, do you think that…. There is a possibility to reuse this part of code in future, or we completely discard it.

[Yoko Saito] 09:48:49
Uh, it is possible. We will reuse the current code.

[Yoko Saito] 09:48:54
Uh, so 14141413. But we are not sure yet.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:48:59
I'm not sure. Depends on the next level of HM Master and other discussion, and how we define the requirement.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:06
Yeah. Yeah. So….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:49:07
Cool. Hi.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:10
Um, so, um, as I…. Um, commented on our meeting notes.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:19
We need to, uh…. Maybe we recruit this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:24
Uh, so we will include this. Relationship name change.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:29
In our next year, anyway. To compare it to the, uh, dependent deduction form, or HR Master.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:37
Project. So, um, we will, uh, include this project. Uh, next year, for sure.

[Yoko Saito] 09:49:43
But we don't know how.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:49:46
Yeah, so, yeah, we will have something similar to next year, but the point is….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:49:52
The scope may be different, or how it will be integrated with the HMaster thing.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:49:58
That is a complete layer. Unclear at this moment. I understood. Yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:50:03
Pleasure with us. So, Liam, and, uh, yeah, I don't know who worked on this project, so I would like to know the exact man-man.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:50:13
When our effort we spent so far. It may be asked by management side that how much effort is wasted for this part.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:50:22
So, please let me know how much effort has been. Has been given for this project so far, including Kiwi.

[Yoko Saito] 09:50:32
So, I think, uh, I mean, our team worked on this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:50:35
So, Rachel? And I think this… this was done by Emerald's team.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:50:38
Me, Chip?

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:50:43
Okay. Yeah, but not only am, but I think also QA4 is there, including QA design testing.

[Yoko Saito] 09:50:43
Right?

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:50:52
Everything. So, I think, Liam, would you please, uh…. Have this, uh, PIC to come up with this information.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:51:08
Okay?

[Yoko Saito] 09:51:12
And also, our… so this one. This one has already debarked.

[Nas] 09:51:19
And yes, we reverse in the… last… last week? Yeah, because… because in last Thursday, we only relay onsizing, and….

[Yoko Saito] 09:51:23
Oh, okay. Okay.

[Nas] 09:51:31
And repair to relate. So, uh, we already took one of the….

[Yoko Saito] 09:51:34
Okay, okay.

[Nas] 09:51:39
Uh, this brochure.

[Yoko Saito] 09:51:41
Okay, thank you very much. And then, uh, I'm….

[Yoko Saito] 09:51:45
I have some concerns about the communication to team members. Are in a literal last week.

[Yoko Saito] 09:51:55
Many developers has done some, um…. Uncomfortable feeling on this….

[Yoko Saito] 09:52:01
Cancellation, and it's reasonable. But, um, I'm….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:52:05
It's okay, I will explain in details that are some to individual… to all the members later on.

[Yoko Saito] 09:52:13
Um, is that okay? So, you can…. So you can explain them. So are you….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:52:14
Yeah, it's okay.

[Yoko Saito] 09:52:19
Yeah, you can explain by using that diagram, the picture. So, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:52:27
Um, sorry about that, but um…. Thank you very much.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:52:30
No, it's, uh, it's not only the… this particular project. There are several other impacts because of this, so….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:52:38
Yeah, yeah, I think…. We can understand this.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:52:43
Yeah, of course, I understand, but I think, uh, engineer…. Of course, they can understand this up-down situation may happen sometime.

[Nas] 09:52:43
Yeah. Okay.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:52:54
Uh, just to reconfirm, so, Saito-san mentioned need to rebutt, and Nas mentioned already, so this already… actually, we didn't release it, so what is needed to rebutt, Nas? What actually rebutt already?

[Nas] 09:53:09
Rework is minimal, because in, uh, last Thursday, we only really relate.

[Nas] 09:53:14
To seizing. Yeah, it will be, uh, just one step to rotation.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:53:16
Yes.

[Nas] 09:53:19
So we need to check out, too, the spacing. Yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:53:22
Okay. Okay, so, uh, Juanita, uh…. It stays our production release point of view, we release it to the stage, and we revert it back to the… from the esters, right?

[Nas] 09:53:34
Hmm, so this… let me just revert more.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:53:36
And another is source code rebutt point of view, so it's….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:53:40
That's all the repository, right?

[Nas] 09:53:42
Yeah, I think… so, I noticed…. Because to me, we did.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:53:47
Yes, yeah, all… yeah, that is correct, and the knowledge to do anything.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:53:52
It's not actually not already, it's…. We actually don't need to do anything.

[Nas] 09:53:52
Yeah.

[Nas] 09:53:58
Yeah, okay, I recommend this one. Yeah, we….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:54:00
But in terms of revert in the repository, source code repository, we need to clean up the code and put this code, uh, in the, maybe.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:54:09
Keep it in the… in another branch somewhere. So that cleanup also needed.

[Nas] 09:54:12
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we…. Yeah. We, uh, keep the cock in the, uh, feature rank, so, uh….

[Nas] 09:54:21
We can use it in next year, I think we don't waste.

[Nas] 09:54:26
A lot of time for…. Maybe just, uh, in this year, we need to, uh, update a bit.

[Nas] 09:54:33
Okay.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:54:35
Yeah, I understand. Just to clarify that this rebutt means what and.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:54:40
What actually we did. Societies and collections are unknown. Yeah, we don't need to take any action, actually.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:54:46
We don't need any rebard things. But the state server, we already deployed, so we will….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:54:51
We will return it back. Something like this. And the source code cleanup part will take a measurement.

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:00
Oh, okay, okay. And, uh, I know that someone, uh, concerned about the, uh, impact to the single parent.

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:08
Uh, we recently, uh, worked. It has an impact, but.

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:12
No need to re-bark, because we will have, um, some, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:18
Product to work on this, uh, work on that, uh. This year's tax reform.

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:24
And we need to update our… this part. Anyway, so, uh, we will….

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:30
Uh, we will leave you, uh. The, um, behavior of the system in this project again. So, uh, no need to do anything at the moment.

[Yoko Saito] 09:55:43
Is that okay?

[Nas] 09:55:45
Foliage just right after he? Can you…? Yeah, yes, I just confirmed this.

[Nas] 09:55:52
Uh, because we have some relevance, uh, tests already. Handle with new relationship giant.

[Nas] 09:55:59
And so, if we re… we can show the relationship matter relations, so in this case, do we need to….

[Yoko Saito] 09:56:00
Uh… no, no, no change. No change is required to the logic.

[Nas] 09:56:09
Chen, uh, the region? Uh….

[Yoko Saito] 09:56:18
So, uh, if… if… I think on…. So, you have a testing with tires, not the, uh, son and daughter?

[Nas] 09:56:26
Yeah, yes, correct.

[Yoko Saito] 09:56:29
Um, but I think the behavior has not been changed. Right?

[Nas] 09:56:34
Behavior and not chance, but the conditions. Will be affected.

[Nas] 09:56:39
Uh, employees, single parents will be affected by the. Uh, relationship quality.

[Nas] 09:56:50
Yeah, because in this theory, we, uh…. We are ways, we will….

[Yoko Saito] 09:56:59
Okay. Yeah.

[Nas] 09:57:00
10 to the time. So, yeah, you can see. Yes. So we need to, uh, revert back.

[Nas] 09:57:06
This one, to the, uh, son or daughter? Yeah, because when….

[Yoko Saito] 09:57:08
Uh, no. No, uh, as long as this works with, uh, daughter and the sun.

[Yoko Saito] 09:57:15
That is okay, but it doesn't work for our daughter and son.

[Nas] 09:57:25
Uh, yes. Because we only train it to Chimes. Yeah.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:57:33
And that means….

[Nas] 09:57:34
Delete, delete. To determine the single parent of middle? Because, uh, when we, uh, relation this building, we, uh, think, uh, the relationship will be released.

[Nas] 09:57:48
And we will, uh, use the residency. Not the, uh, still not out.

[Yoko Saito] 09:57:53
It's terrible, okay.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:57:53
I understand. So, there are some relationships already we consider, considering the relationship master integration.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:58:00
So because… as we are stopping relationship master, so we need to….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:58:05
Update this, and uh…. We need to also work on that.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:58:10
Not the child. Child is relationship master.

[Nas] 09:58:13
On the chart?

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:17
Okay, uh, but…. Uh, again, because we will have some update around here, because, you know, we will have some legislative update around the, uh, single parent, and then.

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:31
Widow. So…. Um, could you hold on for a second?

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:37
And then, for what? Um, then, uh, Asamusan is now creating around this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:41
So, uh…. I won't, uh… I will ask her.

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:47
To incorporate this part. In her PRD.

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:52
So that, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:58:57
We need… we need not to walk. Are….

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:05
Walk several times on this mother. I mean, uh, even if you change this to, uh, daughter and son.

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:12
Uh, it's possible that, um.

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:18
It's possible that we will have another change. Um, because of this, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:24
Toxicity form. So, um, I will ask Asano-san to include, uh, the requirement around this.

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:30
Uh, in… in her PLD. So, um…. Please, um….

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:37
Leave it as it is. Um, for the time being.

[Nas] 09:59:41
Hmm, okay. I will explain this, uh, to, uh, Luna, and maybe, uh, in the PD meeting, uh.

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:48
Yep. Yes?

[Nas] 09:59:49
The PDM team can, uh, research the detail. Yeah.

[Yoko Saito] 09:59:54
Yep.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 09:59:55
That's funny, is it better to pause this one, also? For a while, till we… till PDM side decide how to proceed.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:03
In a very clear way, revise it.

[Yoko Saito] 10:00:08
And so, what do you mean by expose?

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:13
Pause, not expose. Pause.

[Yoko Saito] 10:00:16
Oh…. Opposed, yes. Yes.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:19
Better to pause to waste any further effort. So, after, uh….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:24
Kind of refining, or…. Uh, reviewing this part.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:29
Including Asano-san, maybe Luna corrected, then we will start again there.

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:35
Consideration to develop.

[Yoko Saito] 10:00:39
This has been already released. Right? So….

[Nas] 10:00:44
Yeah, yeah.

[Yoko Saito] 10:00:44
Yeah, so….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:47
I think….

[Nazmul / alam.nazmul] 10:00:52
Then, just leave it as it is. We don't need to take any action.

[Yoko Saito] 10:00:56
No, no, no, not at the moment.

[Nas] 10:01:01
Okay, I think each time, so sorry, uh…. We can book the room, so….

[Yoko Saito] 10:01:05
Oh, yes, yeah.

[Nas] 10:01:08
Yeah, okay, just have…. 10 seconds. Uh, I have to check roadmap variety, so I will relate the meeting to discuss the detail for this one.

[Nas] 10:01:18
Uh, maybe in next week? Because for now, uh, we have a lot of blue tape, not….

[Nas] 10:01:25
Studies are really, so we need to rally. Again, yeah. So, I do….

[Yoko Saito] 10:01:30
Okay.

[Nas] 10:01:31
And we will set the meeting, and we can discuss the detail in last meeting.

[Yoko Saito] 10:01:35
Yeah, yeah, true.

[Nas] 10:01:39
Okay, thank you, everyone.

[Yoko Saito] 10:01:40
Thank you.
