Here’s a clear and concise summary of Saito-san’s explanation for the postponement of the **Relationship Master Revision (1413)** feature:

### ❗ Reason for Postponement of Relationship Master Revision (1413)

**Saito-san explained two main reasons for the postponement:**

---

### 1. **Dependency and Timing Issues with PA and HRIS Systems**

* The Relationship Master changes (e.g., switching from “husband/wife/son/daughter” to “spouse/child”) would affect **data integration** with both the **PA (Personnel Administration)** and **HRIS** systems.
* These systems have **incompatible data structures**, especially around relationship types.
* If 1413 is released, the **import/export processes** between TA ↔ PA and TA ↔ HRIS would **break** unless they are also updated.
* However, the PA team has **no capacity to work on this until at least September**, which is **too late** since TA must complete work by the **end of August**.
* As a result, there is **not enough time** to adjust the integration logic this year.

---

### 2. **Uncertainty in HR Master Project’s Final Design**

* The **HR Master project** has **not finalized** the target data model ("to-be" state) for relationships.
* There's a possibility that the format (e.g., spouse/child vs. husband/wife/son/daughter) may **change again** in the future.
* Implementing the current change now could lead to **rework**, making it inefficient.

---

### 🔄 Potential for Reuse

* Although this year’s release is canceled, Saito-san mentioned that **some of the code may be reusable** in the future, once the data model and timeline are stable.
