Thanks for the detailed thread summary. Here's a breakdown of the context and what you should do next regarding **applying TLS for Redis**:

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary of the Conversation**

* **DocumentDB**: TLS already applied (`ssl: true`, `ssl_ca_cert` set).
* **RDS (Aurora)**:

  * Diagnosis: ‚úÖ TLS applied (`SHOW SESSION STATUS` shows `TLSv1.3`).
  * Staging: ‚ùå TLS not yet applied (shows empty `Ssl_version`).
  * An SSL CA file (`/ssl_cert/ap-northeast-1-bundle.pem`) is added for use.
* **Redis**:

  * Not yet using TLS.
  * Redis version must be **6.x or later** to support TLS.
  * @Nas mentioned a plan to upgrade Redis to **7.x**, but it's not done yet.
  * Client-side support also needed (e.g., Redis gem or driver must support TLS).

---

## üìå **To apply TLS for Redis, do the following:**

### 1. ‚úÖ **Confirm Redis Server Supports TLS**

* Redis must be **v6.0 or higher**.
* Run this to verify:

  ```bash
  redis-server --version
  ```
* Or check in AWS Console under ElastiCache (if you're using managed Redis).

> If not yet upgraded, refer to the Jira ticket `TAXW-2092` for progress. You **must** upgrade first before proceeding.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **Enable TLS on Redis (if using AWS ElastiCache)**

* In AWS ElastiCache:

  * Create a new Redis cluster with TLS enabled, or modify the existing one (if possible).
  * Download the **Redis CA certificate**: [Amazon Root CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/TLS.html#TLS-certs)

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **Update Redis Client Configuration**

For **Rails (Ruby)** projects, if you're using the `redis` gem or `redis-rails`, update the Redis URL in `config/redis.yml` or initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/redis.rb or equivalent
Redis.new(
  url: ENV['REDIS_URL'],
  ssl: true,
  ssl_params: { ca_file: "/path/to/aws-ca-cert.pem" } # Adjust path
)
```

Or using `Redis.current = Redis.new(...)`.

If using Sidekiq:

```yaml
# config/sidekiq.yml
:redis:
  :url: <%= ENV['REDIS_URL'] %>
  :ssl_params:
    ca_file: "/path/to/aws-ca-cert.pem"
```

Set the environment variable:

```env
REDIS_URL=rediss://your-redis-endpoint:6379
```

**Note:** `rediss://` is required for Redis over SSL.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **Test the TLS Connection**

From Rails console:

```ruby
Redis.new(url: ENV['REDIS_URL'], ssl: true).ping
# => "PONG"
```

To verify TLS, try to connect with the `redis-cli` over TLS:

```bash
redis-cli -h <your-endpoint> -p 6379 --tls --cacert /path/to/aws-ca-cert.pem
```

---

### 5. ‚úÖ **Deployment & Environment Configuration**

Make sure to:

* Add the CA certificate in your image/container (`/ssl_cert/redis-ca.pem`).
* Mount the file via Kubernetes secret/ConfigMap if needed.
* Define `REDIS_URL` and paths in `.env` or Kubernetes manifests.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas / Tips

* Redis with TLS often uses **port 6379** or **6380** depending on config. Confirm which is active.
* Don't use self-signed certs in production ‚Äì always use AWS's provided ones.
* Be careful to **test Sidekiq and any background jobs** after TLS is enabled, as they might fail silently if the cert isn't recognized.

Let me know your setup (AWS ElastiCache or self-managed Redis), and I can tailor the instructions.
