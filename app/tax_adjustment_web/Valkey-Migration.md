Migrating from Redis to Valkey on your local machine is very straightforward since Valkey is a "drop-in" fork of Redis. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

## **1. Install Valkey**

**On macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install valkey
```

**On Linux:**
- Download prebuilt binaries from [Valkey Releases](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases), or
- Use Docker (see below).

**With Docker (cross-platform):**
```bash
docker run -d --name valkey -p 6379:6379 valkey/valkey
```

---

## **2. Stop Your Local Redis Server (if running)**

If Redis is running as a service:
```bash
brew services stop redis   # macOS with Homebrew
sudo systemctl stop redis  # Linux with systemd
```
Or stop any running Redis Docker container.

---

## **3. Start Valkey**

**If installed natively:**
```bash
valkey-server
```
This will start Valkey on port 6379 by default (same as Redis).

**If using Docker:**  
Already running from the previous command.

---

## **4. (Optional) Migrate Your Data**

If you have existing Redis data you want to keep:

1. **Dump your Redis data:**
   ```bash
   redis-cli SAVE
   ```
   This creates a `dump.rdb` file in your Redis data directory.

2. **Copy the `dump.rdb` file to Valkey’s data directory.**
   - By default, Valkey will look for `dump.rdb` in the same path as Redis (`/var/lib/valkey` or similar).  
   - If using Docker, you can mount your local directory as a Docker volume.

3. **Start Valkey.**  
   It will load the `dump.rdb` and your data will be there.

---

## **5. No Application Code Changes Needed**

Valkey is protocol-compatible with Redis. Your application (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Python, etc.) can continue to use the same Redis client, URL, and commands.

- Change your environment variable (if needed) from:
  ```
  redis://localhost:6379
  ```
  to
  ```
  redis://localhost:6379
  ```
  (No change needed unless you changed ports or hosts.)

- If you want to confirm you are connected to Valkey:
  ```bash
  redis-cli INFO server
  ```
  Output will include:
  ```
  valkey_version:7.2.x
  ```

---

## **6. (Optional) Uninstall Redis**

If you no longer need Redis:
```bash
brew uninstall redis       # macOS
sudo apt remove redis     # Ubuntu/Debian
```

## **Summary Table**

| Step              | Redis                 | Valkey                  |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Command to start  | `redis-server`       | `valkey-server`         |
| Data persistence  | `dump.rdb`           | `dump.rdb` (same file)  |
| Port              | 6379 (default)       | 6379 (default)          |
| Client            | redis-cli, libraries | Same, no change needed  |

---

**You can switch back and forth between Redis and Valkey at any time, as long as you use the same port and data directory.**
