The current authentication flow doesn't handle expired tokens gracefully, causing users to be logged out unexpectedly. This PR implements a token refresh mechanism to provide a seamless user experience.

## Implementation and Architecture (How)

- Implemented a token refresh interceptor
- Added background token refresh logic
- Updated auth state management to handle refresh scenarios

## Implemented Details (What)

- [x] Added TokenRefreshInterceptor class to handle 401 responses
- [x] Implemented background token refresh 5 minutes before expiration
- [x] Updated auth store to maintain refresh token state
- [x] Added error handling for failed refresh attempts

### Design Comprehensive Layout and screenshots

N/A - Backend implementation

### Tested and Confirmed points

- [x] When the access token expires, system automatically refreshes
- [x] When both tokens expire, user is properly redirected to login
- [x] Background refresh happens 5 minutes before token expiration
- [x] Failed refresh attempts are properly handled
